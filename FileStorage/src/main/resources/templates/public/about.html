About Me

Hello! My name is Mohberte, and I'm a 29-year-old Computer Science graduate with a passion for programming, building apps, and creating websites. I've always been fascinated by the power of technology and its ability to transform ideas into reality, which led me to pursue a career in the tech industry.

In my free time, I enjoy playing video games to unwind and experience various worlds and stories. I believe that keeping both the mind and body active is important, so I regularly work out to maintain a healthy lifestyle. When I'm not busy coding or gaming, I love spending quality time with my family, as they are my biggest support system and inspiration.

I'm proud to showcase my work on my GitHub repository, which you can visit at https://github.com/mohberte. Here, you'll find some of the exciting projects I've been working on, as well as a glimpse of my coding journey. I'm always eager to learn and improve, so feel free to reach out if you have any suggestions or collaboration ideas.
